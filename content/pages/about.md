You might be thinking "shoot that's a lot of stuff" but... it really doesn't take much to learn about reactions when you live inside a lab ( the lab here being my passion, environment and connections combined )


For the last ~8 years I've been lucky enough to learn, work on and teach (for a brief period of time) stuff that i am truly passionate about. Here i post my thoughts on them, things i find interesting and most importantly to articulate my thoughts to understand myself better.

You will find me bragging about stuff i did, occasionally.
