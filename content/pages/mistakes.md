**Being book smart is better than experience** - Nov, 2022

In mid of 2022 i planned to up my game in the devOps side, i started reading books on go and watching tutorials
thinking i understood fast forward 2 months later i had a friend who asked me to help him deploy a [pocketbase](https://pocketbase.io/) project
on a server of his. I was clueless to say the least LMAO so anyway i realized that i need to get my hands dirty to really understand
how things work.



**I am a better follower than a leader** - May, 2020

This one's backstory is a tad bit too private and long to be shared.


**Standing still â‰  regressing** - Feb, 2021

Wrapped up a RN project successfully submitted it to the client, and i had a almost a month of gap since the next project was delayed
i took that time to do some very serious PROCRASTINATION, knowing that i don't consider dev work, work but something i enjoy doing being a couch potato and not doing anything productive was a mistake.
